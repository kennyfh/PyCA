The goal was develop an open source software to recreate cellular automaton on differents meshes  (square, hex, voronoi), widely studied models, such as [Game of Life](https://web.stanford.edu/class/sts145/Library/life.pdf). For this purpose, we have decided to choose the Python programming language, because of its numerous libraries.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Python](https://www.python.org/) (version >= 3.6 recommended) <!-- F-strings https://peps.python.org/pep-0498/ -->
- [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/)
- [Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html)

### Installing

Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/kennyfh/PyCA.git
```

Install the dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt

``` 


## Usage

Run the command `python main.py` to start our software tool.
