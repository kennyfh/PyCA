## Description

The goal was develop an open source software to recreate cellular automaton on differents meshes  (square, hex, voronoi), widely studied models, such as [Game of Life](https://web.stanford.edu/class/sts145/Library/life.pdf).

For this purpose, we have decided to choose the Python programming language, because of its numerous libraries.


## Requirements
* Python >= 3.6 <!-- F-strings https://peps.python.org/pep-0498/ -->
